1. Read asyncio
2. Read asyncore

reorganize imports and directories
improve inflation/deflation maintaining tension
    instead of direct connection to the bladder, 
    go through the loop to a weight? would allow tension to 
    maintain even when bladder is externally deformed

get rpi running

decrease the inflation distance

singleton motor controllers?
    -currently seems like each command is processed by HSIMaster,
    then passed to singleton command executer, to singleton thread 
    specific to each type of command. however bladder spawns a new thread for
    each new command, all of which access the same motors since htey are stored
    in the singleton BladderCommand 

controll.py
.test.py.swo
.test.py.swp
calibrate_cam.py
calibrate_proj.py
test.py (or atleast move)
move command executer to ./commands
./resources in general
