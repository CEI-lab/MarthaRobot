Issue:

The TCP connection from laptop to Intel Aero Board is not working. However, they are both connected to the same access point. And this communication worked for RPi and laptop before. Thus, the TCP python script should be working properly.

Solution:

There is no firewall enabled on RPi. Nevertheless, the firewall in Ubuntu is enabled initially. Therefore, we should enable certain port for the TCP connection.

The command line I have entered is as following:
1. sudo ufw allow <PORT NUMBER>/tcp 	// For TCP connection, it could be udp as well.
2. sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <PORT NUMBER> -j ACCEPT

Keyword:

Ubunut open tcp
