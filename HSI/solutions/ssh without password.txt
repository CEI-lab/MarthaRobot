Problem: 

could not enter the ssh to pi without the password

Solution:

1. The Laptop you are trying to ssh from will generate the password. 
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    
2. Two files rsa and rsa.pub will be generated under your laptop folder ~/.ssh. 

3. Copy the rsa.pub into the server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

4. Then, you should be able to log in the serever withouth prompting the key anymore.
